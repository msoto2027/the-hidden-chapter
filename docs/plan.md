## Project Overview
The Hidden Chapter website is a two-page HTML/CSS site for an independent bookstore.  
This project demonstrates **web development skills** and **project management principles** (PMUPM Chapters 3, 4, 7).  

The website provides information about the bookstore, its offerings, and community events, while following best practices for **repository organization** and **documentation**.

## Project Milestones & Timeline

The project will follow a series of milestones to stay on track:

- **Project Scope:** Finish `scope.md` by Feb 22, 2026.  
- **Repository Setup:** Create the GitHub repo and make the first commit by Feb 22, 2026.  
- **Homepage:** Build `index.html` and the initial CSS by Feb 23, 2026.  
- **About Page:** Build `about.html` with mission, values, and community sections by Feb 23, 2026.  
- **CSS Refinement:** Make the site responsive and apply the cozy bookstore theme by Feb 25, 2026.  
- **Testing & Feedback:** Validate HTML/CSS, test in browsers, and get feedback by Feb 27, 2026.  
- **Documentation:** Finish `plan.md` and `retrospective.md` by Feb 26, 2026.  
- **Deployment:** Publish the website on GitHub Pages by Feb 27, 2026.  
- **Final Review:** Make any last edits and submit the project by March 1, 2026.  

## Risks

Potential risks include missing deadlines, coding errors, repository disorganization, and delays in receiving feedback. These will be managed by following the milestones closely, validating HTML/CSS in multiple browsers, maintaining a clear folder and file structure with frequent commits, and requesting feedback early to allow time for revisions.
