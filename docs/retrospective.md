# Project Retrospective | The Hidden Chapter Small Business Website

## What Went Well
Working on The Hidden Chapter website went really well in a few key areas. I was able to create a **two-page HTML/CSS website** that is responsive and looks cozy and professional. Planning and organizing the project with a clear **scope and WBS** made building the site much easier. I also kept my **GitHub repository organized** with frequent commits and clear documentation. Testing my code and getting feedback from fellow peers and family members helped me catch mistakes early and improve the site before final submission.  

## What I Learned
This project taught me a lot about how web development and project management go hand in hand. I learned the importance of planning, breaking a project into smaller tasks, and staying organized. I also got hands-on experience with **HTML, CSS, responsive design, and GitHub Pages**, which gave me more confidence in my coding skills. Testing across devices showed me how important it is to think about different users and screens when building a website.  

## What Could Be Improved
There are a few things I would do differently next time. I could have **integrated external sources** for featured books instead of using only static content. Adding **subtle animations or interactive elements** earlier would have made the site feel even more polished. I also realized that **starting testing and feedback earlier** would have given me more time to tweak the design and layout.  

## Final Thoughts
Overall, this project was a great learning experience. I feel proud of how the website turned out and how much I learned about combining **project management** and **web development skills**. Seeing the project come together and finally live on **GitHub Pages** was very rewarding. Moving forward, I want to experiment with **dynamic content and interactive features** to make websites even more engaging.
