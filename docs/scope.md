# TOOL: PROJECT SCOPE STATEMENT

## Project Name: Project 03: The Hidden Chapter Small Business Website

## Project Purpose
The purpose of this project is to design and develop a professional, two-page website for **The Hidden Chapter**, a independent bookstore. This project demonstrates the application of both project management principles (PMUPM Chapters 3, 4, and 7) and web development skills (HTML/CSS).  

The website will serve as a marketing and informational platform, showcasing the bookstore's offerings, contact information, and community presence. It will also demonstrate proper GitHub repository organization, professional documentation, and version control practices.

## Feedback Loops
Feedback will be obtained through multiple channels:

- **Professor Review:** Grading and feedback on project deliverables.  
- **Self-Review:** Testing website layout, navigation, and responsiveness.  
- **Peer Feedback:** Optional feedback from classmates to improve scope, layout, or documentation.  
- **Validation Tools:** HTML/CSS validators and browser testing to ensure best practices.

All feedback will be incorporated before final submission.

## Project Description
This project involves planning, designing, developing, and deploying a small business website consisting of two pages and a shared external CSS file:

### Website Structure
- **Homepage (`index.html`)**
  - Hero section with bookstore name and tagline
  - Welcome message  
  - Featured books section with book cards (Title, Author, Price)
    - Information will be pulled from a reliable vendor.  
  - Store hours and contact information  
  - Navigation linking to About page  

- **About Page (`about.html`)**
  - Description of bookstore mission and values  
  - Community engagement section (events, book clubs)  
  - Navigation linking back to homepage  

- **External Stylesheet (`style.css`)**
  - Provides consistent styling across both pages  
  - Includes layout, typography, colors, and responsive design  

### Documentation
All project documentation will reside in the `docs/` folder and include:

- `scope.md` – Detailed Project Scope Statement (this document)  
- `plan.md` – Project Plan with TAME risk analysis and Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)  
- `retrospective.md` – Post-project reflection addressing what went well, what went wrong, and what I would have done differently  

The project will be deployed using GitHub Pages, and the repository will include a professional `README.md` linking to the live website and documentation folder.

## People Resources
- **Student (Project Manager & Developer):** Responsible for planning, coding, testing, documentation, and repository management.
